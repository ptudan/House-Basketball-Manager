	/* Don't know how to store all of these statistics yet but the ones I want are:
		3pt mid, 3pt wings - determines likelyhood to be passed the ball while there, chances shot goes in
		2pt 0-5, 2pt 5-10, 2pt 10-15, 2pt 15+ 
		offball speed, onball speed
		passing to post, passing to wings - higher means lower chances of interception
		handles - higher means less chance of being stolen from, higher chance of ankle breaker
		vertical - affects 2pt 0-5 and rebounding, purely magnitude stat
		boxing out - higher raises other members rebounding, lower lowers it
		rebounding - 
		humor type, humor rating
		drug/alcohol use -- probably not in all likelihood
		offball/onball post/wing defense
		court vision - lowers chance to be stolen, raises 
		popularity - closer in average the team is the higher chemistry is
		BBIQ - the higher the more likely they choose the correct shots/ passes
		jealousy - the higher the lower stats will be when PT is low
		racism - the higher the lower chemistry will be when mixing races on team
		selfishness - higher likelyhood to shoot (can be good when players are good)
